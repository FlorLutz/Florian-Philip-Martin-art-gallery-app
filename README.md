# 4th Spiced Project

## Description
This was the forth project of the spiced full-stack bootcamp. It was a group-project, in which my colleages, Mart√≠n, Philip, and I created an application using NextJS to display, like and comment on art pieces.

## Key Learnings
- creating routes with fixed pagenames and dynamic routes with slugs with NextJS' pages router
- using react hooks like useState, useRouter and useLocalStorage
- creating complex nested components and passing props
- including like and comment features
- applying complex CSS-styling with Tailwind-CSS like shadows, fonts and conditional coloring of nav-elements

## Additional info
The styling focused on a minimalist arty look with dark blue colors from Tailwind's cyan color palette.
